# pianoSimulator
The program simulation.py reads a text file for the selected song. It then converts the encoded notes and rhythms into wave objects and plays them in sequence.

Several classes for wave, note, piano, and song objects are included in the musicClasses.py program. Acompanying methods encode text files into wave arrays that can then be played using the computer's default media player as a .wav file.
